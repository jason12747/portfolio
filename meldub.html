            <h2>Mitis</h2>
            <p>MitiS has been perfecting his special breed of piano-driven melodic bass since 2010. Brought up as a Classical pianist in Pennsylvania, MitiS, aka Joseph Torre performs a live set that combines his production chops and piano roots to get the absolute best of both worlds. He’s an artist in the purest sense, pouring his soul into every release. And as his vision of the world becomes more refined, so does his writing. Mitis says, “I find myself unable to stop making phat basses, heavy beats,and throwing melodies into the mix… I can’t think of anything else more appetizing; It’s the new age Classical.”<br></br></p>

            <h2>Seven Lions</h2>
            <p>Producer Seven Lions has never had a problem breaking rules and transcending musical boundaries to satisfy his creative vision. Catching his break after winning a Beatport remix contest in 2012 with his dubstep-focused version of Above & Beyond’s “You Got to Go”, Seven Lions, born Jeff Montalvo, garnered early support from the likes of Skrillex and his OWSLA label. 2013 tour dates with Porter Robinson and Krewella pushed Montalvo and his genre-bending production style to the forefront of the modern electronic music scene.

                Putting sheer technical production prowess to work in soulful, deep, hybridized creations all distinctly his own, the multi-talented musician is single-handedly changing the sonic landscape for future generations to come by bridging the gap between the soaring, ethereal vibe of trance and intensely adrenalizing bass music.<br></br></p>
